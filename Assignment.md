## **Assignment**
Your game is going to play against the computer, so **begin with a function called `computerPlay` that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'.** *We'll use this function in the game to make the computer's play.* 

**Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the `playerSelection` and  `computerSelection` - then return a string that declares the winner of the round (e.g. `You Lose! Paper beats Rock` )**

|| make your function's playerSelection parameter **case-insensitive** (so users can input rock, ROCK, RoCK or any other variation) ||

**Important note:** you want to `return` the results of this function call, *not* `console.log()` them.

**Write a NEW fuction called `game()`. Use the previous function inside this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.**
